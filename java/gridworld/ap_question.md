#Question

Modify the bug runner code, so that when two bugs collide:

* They pause
* Another bug is created with a color that is a combination of the two initial bugs'
* The two initial bugs continue in the same direction they came from
* The baby bug starts moving in a different direction


For example, you can start with:

public void mateWith(Bug bug) {}
