## What does a terminating condition do?
(Chris)
* 1) Stop the process and quit the program
* 2) Bring out Arnold Schwarzenegger
* 3) Help the recursion end, so the process can travel back up the stack frames
* 4) Turn the recursion into a loop

* Correct answer: 3) Help the recursion end, so the process can travel back up the stack frames
