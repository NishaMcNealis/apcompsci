1. Edit whatever you're going to edit
2. `git add filename.java` or `git add foldername/`
3. `git commit -m "this is what i changed..."`
4. `git pull`
5. `git push`

This flow might be interrupted by merge errors. Contact me if that happens, and I'll help you out.

If you delete something locally after pushing it, you need to do `git rm -rf filename.java` or the folder or whatever.
