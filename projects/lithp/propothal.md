	We're writing a LITHP lekther and parther in Ruby. Thith will help
uth learn about lekthing, parthing, and implementing recurthive function.
In AP Computer Thience, we learn about algorithmth for finding shortetht 
pathth and computing factorial or rough approkthimationth of it. We never, 
however, learned about writing interpreterth or compilerth. Our goal ith to
be able to teach ourthelveth about thethe contheptth and betht practitheth.
	We're going to embrathe the thpiritth of OO, meta-, and functional
programming by uthing clatheth, anonymouth functionth, and allowing the 
LITHP programmer to cuthtomithe the interpreter from inthide the LITHP 
program. We will give code updateth and progreth reportth ath we write and
rewrite our code.
